Analyzed to compare their efficiency in processing a large dataset using SQL Query, Cache and Parquet partitioned. The uncached method took an astonishingly long time of 0.8117940425872803 seconds to complete the analysis. In contrast, the cached method was significantly faster and took only 0.29233217239379883 seconds to complete the same analysis. The parquet partitioned method was the most efficient and completed the analysis in only 0.24123477935791016 seconds. These results demonstrate that utilizing caching and partitioning techniques can significantly improve the runtime of data analysis tasks for large datasets.
